> Hi, My name is Jenn Hoskinson. I've been married to my hubby for 21 yrs and we live in Spanaway. We have 4 kiddos ages 20, 17, 15, and 12. We have lots of cats and dogs. I'm excited to start this new journey!

__What Growth Mindset means to me__

1.  I don't have to be super smart to learn a new skill.
2.  If I put in effort and hard work, anything is possible.
3.  It's not only ok to fail, it's encouraged.
4.  ASK FOR HELP!!!
5.  Lastly, look to others that have experience! Could be the missing piece to your puzzle!
